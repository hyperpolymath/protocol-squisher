= Contributing Guide

== Getting Started

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch from `main`
3. Sign off commits (`git commit -s`)
4. Submit a pull request

== Especially Valuable Contributions

* New format analyzers (see `crates/protocol-squisher-*-analyzer`)
* Real-world schema examples for testing
* Edge cases that break the invariant
* Performance optimizations (after correctness is proven)

== Commit Guidelines

* Conventional commits: `type(scope): description`
* Sign all commits (DCO required)
* Atomic, focused commits

== Testing

All adapters must pass property-based testing:

[source,bash]
----
cargo test
cargo test --all-features
----

== The Invariant

Every contribution must maintain the core invariant:

____
If it compiles, it carries. Every adapter guarantees transport.
____

== License

Contributions licensed under PMPL-1.0-or-later.
