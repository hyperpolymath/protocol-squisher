## Next Steps (Before Launch)

### Required Checks

- [ ] **Verify all examples work**: Run `cd examples/zero-copy-demo && ./build.sh && python test.py`
- [ ] **Check performance numbers**: Re-run benchmarks if code changed
- [ ] **Update GitHub links**: If repo URL differs from `github.com/hyperpolymath/protocol-squisher`
- [ ] **Add social handles**: Replace `@hyperpolymath` with actual handle
- [ ] **Review tone**: Ensure announcements match your voice

### Optional Enhancements

- [ ] **Add screenshots**: CLI output for blog post
- [ ] **Create GIF demos**: For Twitter/Reddit
- [ ] **Record video**: Terminal session demo
- [ ] **Add diagrams**: Architecture visualization

## Response Template Quick Reference

**"Why not JSON everywhere?"**
> JSON works but loses performance and type info. We give you zero-copy when possible (Concorde, ~1ns), fall back to JSON only when necessary (Wheelbarrow), and tell you the cost upfront.

**"How is this different from Protobuf?"**
> Protobuf requires everyone use the same format. We bridge *existing* formats you can't easily change.

**"Can I trust the proofs?"**
> Yes. 4 theorems proven in Agda, cross-validated in Lean. Proofs in `/proofs`, verify yourself with `agda` or `lean`.

**"Why not hand-write FFI?"**
> Time (5 lines vs 200+), correctness (proven vs manual), maintenance (auto-regen vs manual), performance analysis (transport class warnings).

## What Makes These Announcements Good

1. **Honesty First**: We don't hide Wheelbarrow overhead or limitations
2. **Show, Don't Tell**: Code examples in every announcement
3. **Proof-Backed**: Emphasize formal verification (uncommon in tooling)
4. **Performance Numbers**: Real benchmarks, not vague claims
5. **Problem-Focused**: Start with the pain point developers feel
6. **Call-to-Action**: Clear next steps (try examples, report issues, contribute)
7. **Accessible**: Technical depth but approachable writing
