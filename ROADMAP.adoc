== Anti-Goals

**Things we explicitly won't do:**

- ❌ Optimize before proving correctness
- ❌ Support every format before validating approach
- ❌ Compromise the invariant for performance
- ❌ Become a full RPC framework (stay focused on data)
- ❌ Vendor lock-in (always open source, always portable)

== Open Questions

**Things we need to figure out:**

1. **Naming:** Should generated code reference "squisher"? Or be invisible?
2. **Ownership:** For FFI, who owns the data after crossing boundary?
3. **Versioning:** How to handle schema evolution in adapters?
4. **Caching:** Can we cache generated adapters safely?
5. **Distribution:** Crate, binary, service, or all three?

== Contributing to the Roadmap

**This roadmap is not set in stone.**

If you see:
- A missing format pair that would be impactful
- A hard problem we haven't considered
- A better ordering of phases
- A use case we haven't imagined

→ Open an issue or MR. This is a collaborative exploration.

== Timeline Caveats

**These are estimates, not commitments.**

Hard problems will surface. The invariant might break (we'll fix it or document impossibility). Real-world use cases will reshape priorities.

**The only fixed points:**
1. MVP must prove the invariant
2. Python ↔ Rust comes first (maximum impact)
3. We ship incrementally, not big-bang

Everything else is negotiable based on what we learn.
